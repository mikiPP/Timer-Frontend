# Timer-Frontend 

This is an application that his goal is input automatically the hours that the user has spend in his task.


- As simple at it sounds, the only things that this app does are:

    - CRUD of task in local or remote.   
    - CRUD of user. If the app only will be used in local you won't need to create an user.
    - Count the time that user has spend in each task.  
    - Export the time (in hours) to the redmine aplication.
    
- To do that, the app has:

    -Bootsrap 4.  
    -Jquery 3.4.1.  
    -JS.  
    -HTML 5 && CSS 3.  
    -Moments.     
    -Font Awesome.   
    -And one Backend that is [here!](https://github.com/mikiPP/Timer)
    
- Instructions:   

The instructions are only if you want to do the automatically imputation in redmine. 
You must do this, if not, you won't be able to use it.

    1. You have to have the backend too.  
    2. Config in backend application.properties your redmine url.  
    3. Run both front and backend.  
    4. Create an user with your redmine key.  
    5. Put as task's name the redmine task id.  
    6. Click the play button.  
    7. And when you have finished the task, click into "export to redmine".  
    
And then, you will have finished your atomatically imputation.
